        <h1>Generation Of Networks</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
       <h2><u>1G - First Generation</u></h2>
       <br>
       <br>
       <h3>1G stands for the first generation of mobile networks that were designed to provide basic voice calling services. 1G networks started in the early 1980s and were introduced in different parts of the world through various FDMA-based analogue technologies, including AMPS, NMT, TACS, J-TACS and C-Netz.</h3>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2><u>2G – Second Generation</u></h2>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3>2G stands for the second generation of mobile networks that initially offered voice calls, text messages and limited mobile internet. 2G networks started in the early 1990s and were introduced in different parts of the world through various digital technologies, including GSM, D-AMPS and IS-95.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2><u>3G – Third Generation</u></h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>3G stands for the third generation of mobile networks that offer voice, text and data services. The technologies that enable 3G are UMTS and CDMA2000 which are based on the CDMA technology.</h3>
        <br>
        <h2><u>4G – Fourth Generation</u></h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>4G stands for the fourth generation of mobile networks that are data-only networks enabled by the LTE technology. 4G networks use packet-switching to offer IP-based voice calls and text messages in addition to high-speed mobile data. LTE is the 4G technology for both UMTS and CDMA2000.</h3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2><u>5G – Fifth Generation</u></h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>5G stands for the fifth generation of mobile networks that are data-only and offer average download speeds of around 150 to 200 Mbps. It is the latest generation of mobile networks enabled by the New Radio technology (NR). 5G networks can offer latencies as low as one millisecond.</h3>
